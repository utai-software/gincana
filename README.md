# Gincana
Gincana is a groundbreaking GIS game that revolutionizes geographic play. Track movements via mobile, enter geofences, earn points, answer location-based questions, and watch videos for an interactive experience. The repository includes both server and Android tracking app, providing everything needed to create and run location-based games.

# Gincana, How it works
Gincana is a location-based GIS game that utilizes mobile devices to track players' movements in real-time. Here's how it works:

- Tracking: Players move in the real world while the app tracks their location through GPS.
- Geofences: The game sets virtual boundaries (geofences) in specific areas. When a player enters one, the game triggers events.
- Points System: Players earn points by entering these geofences, completing tasks, or answering questions related to the location.
- Interactive Content: Upon entering a geofence, players may be prompted to answer questions, view videos, or complete challenges, making the game both engaging and educational.
- Multiplayer: Players can compete or collaborate to achieve the highest scores.
- Server Connection: The server manages the game logic, keeps track of scores, and pushes updates to players.

This blend of real-world navigation and digital interaction creates a fun, dynamic geographical game experience.
