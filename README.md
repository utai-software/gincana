# Gincana
Gincana is a groundbreaking GIS game that revolutionizes geographic play. Track movements via mobile, enter geofences, earn points, answer location-based questions, and watch videos for an interactive experience. The repository includes both server and Android tracking app, providing everything needed to create and run location-based games.

# Gincana, How it works
Gincana is a location-based GIS game that utilizes mobile devices to track players' movements in real-time. Here's how it works:

- Tracking: Players move in the real world while the app tracks their location through GPS.
- Geofences: The game sets virtual boundaries (geofences) in specific areas. When a player enters one, the game triggers events.
- Points System: Players earn points by entering these geofences, completing tasks, or answering questions related to the location.
- Interactive Content: Upon entering a geofence, players may be prompted to answer questions, view videos, or complete challenges, making the game both engaging and educational.
- Multiplayer: Players can compete or collaborate to achieve the highest scores.
- Server Connection: The server manages the game logic, keeps track of scores, and pushes updates to players.

This blend of real-world navigation and digital interaction creates a fun, dynamic geographical game experience.

# Inspired on Enemy of the State film (Will Smith)

[Watch the trailer on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJjcX--0rvk)

Explanation of the Gincana Based on "Enemy of the State":
Concept: The gincana is a game of strategy, stealth, and quick thinking, set in an environment where players must complete tasks while being monitored by an unseen "state" or authority. The objective is to gather pieces of critical information (data or clues) scattered throughout different locations while avoiding detection by agents of the surveillance system.

Roles:

Players (Targets): Similar to Will Smith’s character in Enemy of the State, the players are ordinary individuals who accidentally come into possession of sensitive information. Their goal is to gather more data from various locations and avoid being caught by the "agents."
Agents (Surveillance): A group of players or moderators takes the role of the "state" or agents, using surveillance tools like cameras, drones (real or simulated), and digital tracking methods to find and stop the targets.
Game Mechanics:

Surveillance Challenge: In certain checkpoints, players will need to complete tasks while being watched by cameras or drones. They must figure out how to avoid detection—whether through hacking devices (puzzles), disabling cameras (finding hidden codes), or navigating around them (stealth).
Data Collection: Critical pieces of information (USB drives, QR codes, or encrypted messages) are hidden in various locations. Players must locate and retrieve these items while being pursued by agents.
Evasion Tactics: Players can use disguises, decoys, and misdirection to escape from the agents. If caught, they might be "interrogated" (given penalties or tasks to complete) before they can resume.
Tech Puzzles: Players might have to solve digital or hacking challenges (decoding messages, bypassing firewalls, or unlocking "data vaults") using smartphones or real-world tools. These puzzles could simulate breaking into a government system or disabling tracking mechanisms.
Objectives: The game could be divided into rounds or levels:

Level 1: Escape Detection: Players start with a map and must reach the first checkpoint without being spotted by surveillance.
Level 2: Data Retrieval: Players find and decode the first clue, leading them to another location, while agents try to track them.
Level 3: Final Mission: The players must upload their collected data to a server or hand it over to a "whistleblower," representing the climax of the game. However, by this stage, the agents are on full alert and have access to better tools to catch them.
Environment: The setting could be a city neighborhood, a school, or a large building complex where surveillance systems like cameras, drones, or agent actors are scattered. Players would feel the same kind of pressure as Will Smith’s character, constantly on the run, unsure who to trust, and needing to outsmart the system.

Technology: To enhance the experience, the game could involve real tech elements like GPS tracking, AR (augmented reality) clues, or phone apps that simulate hacking into secure networks.

Summary:
In this gincana, players would immerse themselves in a world where every move is watched, every decision matters, and their survival depends on their ability to evade detection and gather crucial information. Just like in Enemy of the State, they would feel the tension of being hunted by a faceless and omnipotent system, while using their wits and teamwork to win the game.
